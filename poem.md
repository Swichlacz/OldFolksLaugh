# Old Folks Laugh

by Maya Angelou 

They have spent their <br>
content of simpering,<br>
holding their lips this<br>
and that way, winding<br>
the lines between<br>
their brows. Old folks<br>
allow their bellies to jiggle like slow<br>
tambourines.<br>
The hollers<br>
rise up and spill<br>
over any way they want.<br>
When old folks laugh, they free the world.<br>
They turn slowly, slyly knowing<br>
the best and the worst<br>
of remembering.<br>
Saliva glistens in<br>
the corners of their mouths,<br>
their heads wobble<br>
on brittle necks, but<br>
their laps<br>
are filled with memories.<br>
When old folks laugh, they consider the promise<br>
of dear painless death, and generously<br>
forgive life for happening<br>
to them. <br>
